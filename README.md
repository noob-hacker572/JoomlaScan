# JoomlaScan

I am not the original author of this code; I found it in the repository https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan. The original script is written in Python 2, and I have modified certain aspects to ensure compatibility with Python 3.

You can access the original version here: Original JoomlaScan Repository https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan.

# Usage

git clone https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan.git
